# Contribution guide

This repository is about building an open source portfolio management system. You can contribute to any part of the project from a small UI change to a humangous change in the system architecture. You can find current issues on the [issues tab](https://github.com/Portfolio-Shop/portfolioshop/issues) or create a new issue there. Once issue is assigned to you, you may fork the repo (if not done already) and start working on the perticular task. Once the task is done, create a pull request and wait till it gets merged. Don't ping or assign reviewers.

## Before you start
